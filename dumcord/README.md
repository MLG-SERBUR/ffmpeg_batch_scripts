libx264 always yields better quality than nvenc, even better than hevc_nvenc 2 pass at p7 preset. At 10MB limit, nvenc quality does not look good.

But nvenc is much faster.

h264 is compatible with most devices. iOS freezes with h265. I haven't messed around with webm and av1 much, but av1 takes longer than h264, and idk ios compat.

I have it dump the result here so it doesn't get lost in my source folder.
