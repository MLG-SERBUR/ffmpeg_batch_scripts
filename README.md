A repo of some scripts to quickly modify or compress videos.

Also some notes on how I create videos.

I have this in this account as these are primarily intended for non-important media (gaming clips) or internet delivery (compression for serving on internet). Archival scripts/commands I'll have posted elsewhere whenever I get around to publishing them from my OneNote.
