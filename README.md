A repo of Windows ffmpeg scripts for quickly compressing and/or modifying videos.

Drag and drop your videos on top of the desired ffmpeg script.

These are primarily intended for internet delivery (gaming clips and compression for serving on internet). Archival scripts/commands I'll have posted elsewhere whenever I get around to publishing them from my OneNote.
